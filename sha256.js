// Basic example of SHA256 hashing algorithm

// In JavaScript, no native function exists to generate an SHA256 hash and so this functionality has been borrowed from the following website:
// https://geraintluff.github.io/sha256/

// It may provide greater clarity to compare the additional code in this file with its replacement `hash()` function within the `sha256.php` file.

function hash(ascii) {
	function rightRotate(value, amount) {
		return (value>>>amount) | (value<<(32 - amount));
	};
	
	var mathPow = Math.pow;
	var maxWord = mathPow(2, 32);
	var lengthProperty = 'length'
	var i, j; // Used as a counter across the whole file
	var result = ''

	var words = [];
	var asciiBitLength = ascii[lengthProperty]*8;
	
	//* caching results is optional - remove/add slash from front of this line to toggle
	// Initial hash value: first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes
	// (we actually calculate the first 64, but extra values are just ignored)
	var hash = sha256.h = sha256.h || [];

///
// Generating a salt
///

// In this scenario, our aim is to create a secure hash from the user's password.

// Working with large numbers of users, it is likely that some share the same password, username etc. and so creating a hash solely using any
// of these strings would not provide a great deal of security.

// To solve this problem, we create what is known as a 'salt'.
// The salt is a string which is unique to the user and/or application, but which does not contain any sensitive information such as a password or username.
// In addition to being unique, the salt should also be of length equal to or greater than the output. For this example we will create an sha256 hash,
// so the salt should be at least 256 bits long.

// We can create a pseudo-random string that is 256 characters long, however there is no way to ensure that this string will be unique.

// In order to solve this problem, I have migrated the PHP code from the following article:
// https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/php/how-to-generate-a-random-string-with-php.html
// Note that an additional `rand()` function was created as a substitute for the native PHP function discussed in the article.
// This function generates a random whole number between two given numbers. This is not cryptographically secure and offers no measure of security in itself.

function rand(min, max) {
  var min = min || 0,
      max = max || 2048;

  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}

function getRandomString(n) {
    let characters = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
    let randomString = '';
  
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let index = rand(0, characters.length - 1);
        randomString += characters[index];
    }
  
    return randomString;
}

// To finally create our salt, we call the `now()` method on Javascript's built-in `Date` object to grab the current UNIX timestamp and then append a random, 256-bit string to it.

let salt = Date.now() + getRandomString(256);


///
// Generating a hash
///

// Once we have our salt, we attach it as a prefix to the user's password and pass it as a parameter to the `hash()` function.
// Unlike the PHP example stored in this repo, the `hash()` function takes only one argument.
// If you would like me to include examples of other algorithms then please let me know which algorithms
// you would like to implement in the 'issues' section of this repository.

let saltPasswordCombination = hash($salt + 'Password123');


///
// Additional notes
///

// It is important to remember that this code should only ever be executed client-side, and the user's password should never be transmitted over the internet.

// In a production environment, the salt would only be generated when a user creates a new account.
// The salt would then be stored in a database alongside their username and the value of the `saltPasswordCombination` variable above,
// but the database would not store the user's password.

// Whenever an existing user attempts to login to the site, the client makes a request to the server and retrieves the salt from the database.
// The client executes the `hash()` function, using the salt from the database in place of the `salt` variable in the above example.
// The resulting hash is then sent back to the server where it is compared against the hash that was stored in the database when the user created their account.
// If both hashes are the same, then the user must have provided the correct password and is allowed access to the site.
// If the hashes are not the same, then the user must have provided an incorrect password and is not granted access to the site.

// If a user wishes to change their password, a new value is generated using the same salt and the new password and the resulting hash replaces the
// hash that was previously stored in the database, to be compared against future login attempts.
